# Lisp Web Tales

Markdown source for Pavel Penev's Lisp Web Tales 

I want to maintain this repo since it's abandoned as stated in [his blog](http://blog.ppenev.com/)

> Also, check out my first book: Lisp Web Tales. It's about web
> development with Common Lisp. You ca>n read in for free, or pay as
> much as you want for it. This book is abandoned and no will not be
> updated, typos, bugs and inacuracies will stay forever, sorry. I
> recommend you don't pay for it and just download it for free.
